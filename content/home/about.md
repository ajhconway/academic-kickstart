# Biography

I am a PhD student in computer science at Rutgers University, where
I am advised by Martin Farach-Colton.

My research interests are in external memory theory and storage systems. My
recent publications include work on [file system
aging](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/pubs/fast17.pdf), [external memory hash
tables](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9043/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2018-39.pdf)
and [the analysis of storage optimization
heuristics](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611975482.155).

I am a member of the BetrFS team, which built and maintains the BetrFS
prototype file system. BetrFS is designed around the principles of
write-optimization, and is built using variants of $B^\varepsilon$-trees.
